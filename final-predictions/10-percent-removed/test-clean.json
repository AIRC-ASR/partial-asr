  {
    "prediction": "but already at a point in economic evolution the origins of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to require derivative growth"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "such consumption as falls through the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not to their own comfort and fullness of life"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "with a further advance in culture this term of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a taboo or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily"

    "prediction": "in the nature of things luxuries and the comf belong to the leisure class"

    "prediction": "under the taboo certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the users"

    "prediction": "with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal trend the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters"
  },

    "prediction": "the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of convivia these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives"
  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "but the general distinction is not on that account we looked"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accouterments and those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments"

    "prediction": "the modern organization of industry works in the same direction by another line"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is enlightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of liberty than in the country"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general repute"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the result is a great mobility of the labrum perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pretty evenly between them at the outset"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the 1st place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency nature"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men labor upon productive efficiency and on whatever it is of human use"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "a reconciliation between the 2 conflicting requirements and in intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs that in order to effectually mend the consumer is good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertocation"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspiracy"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation characterized as wasteful"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison"
  },
