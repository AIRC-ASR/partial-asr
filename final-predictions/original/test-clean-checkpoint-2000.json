  },
  {
    "prediction": "and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism"

  {
    "prediction": "the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "and what sort of evidence is logically possible"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being 5 minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "all that i am doing is to use its logical tunability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but i do not think such an inference is warranted"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend is face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "familiarity is a filling capable of degrees"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of 2 remembered events"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the 1st of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidence of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "simmons 2 books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "this is familiar"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "a further stage is recognition"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this 1st sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this 1st sense of the word"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at 1st sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence and virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition"
  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so"

  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "i have got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman but perhaps i better keep the plot a secret for the moment"
  },

    "prediction": "anyhow it is jolly exciting and i can do the dialog alright"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "lend me your ear for 10 minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is"
  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "ham do you be or not to be"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "now the object of this soliquy is plain"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "indeed irresolution meaning the keynote of hamlet is soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole 30 lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist is meaning"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we moderns however see the absurdity of it"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "if it be granted 1st that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage type think how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural"

  },
  {
    "prediction": "he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "edison had installed his historic 1st great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight 2 wire system throughout of the tree kind"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not only for the larger territory opening but also for the compact district of large cities"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the 3 wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it was spatially suited for a trial plan also in the early days when a yield of 6 or 8 lamps to the horsepower was considered subject for congratulation"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the 3 wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the 4th before we started up"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but the plant ran and it was the 1st 3 wire station in this country"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in 1883"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the arc lamp installed outside a customer is premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "hence the addison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in december 1888 mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the 6 years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1000 lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "he weighed and re waved the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the problem was solved"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "we had meters in which there were 2 bottles of liquid"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "kenneth and beth refrain from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the state is prison as a consequence of his rash act"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "i can not see it in that light said the old lawyer"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "he was softhearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he did not stop to count the cost"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made"
  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "sorry we have not any reception room in the jail"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there is a bench here"
  },

    "prediction": "i did not stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i am glad i did it"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "then rogers would not do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin"
  },

    "prediction": "he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them"
  },
  {
