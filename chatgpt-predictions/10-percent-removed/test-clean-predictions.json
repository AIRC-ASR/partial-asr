  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is enlightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living than in the country"
  },

  },
  {
    "prediction": "under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field pretty evenly between them at the outset"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to labor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements and the intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the corrected top1 asr transcription is the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs that in order to effectively mend the consumer is good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "the corrected top1 asr transcription is the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no depreciation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspiracy"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation characterized as wasteful"
  },
  {
    "prediction": "in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison"
